## Randomized search with XGBoost

This short script shows a way to use randomized search for hyperparameter tuning of XGBoost.  

The data is taken from Kaggle's Home Credit Default test and parts of the data-engineering is taken from Will Koehresen's [gentle introduction](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction).  

The aim is to show an easy way to prepare a dataset and apply randomized search for a XGBoost classifier.  

Enjoy! :)
